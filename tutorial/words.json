For over a hundred years before \"useful\" entered our language, \"utile\" served us well on its own. We borrowed \"utile\" from Middle French in the 15th century. The French derived it from Latin  utilis,  meaning \"useful,\" which in turn comes from  uti,  meaning \"to use.\" \"Uti\" (the past participle of which is \"usus\") is also the source of our \"use\" and \"useful.\" We've been using \"use\" since at least the 13th century, but we didn't acquire \"useful\" until the late 16th century, when William Shakespeare inserted it into  King John . Needless to say, we've come to prefer \"useful\" over \"utile\" since then, though \"utile\" functions as a very usable synonym. Other handy terms derived from \"uti\" include \"utilize,\" \"usury,\" \"abuse\" and \"utensil.\"", "definitions": {"adjective": [": useful"]}}{"word": "utile dulci", "url":
