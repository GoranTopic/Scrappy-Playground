She was renowned for her saintliness and is traditionally said to have died of a swelling in her throat, which she took as a judgment upon her fondness for wearing necklaces in her youth. Her shrine became a principal site of pilgrimage in England. An annual fair was held in her honor on October 17th, and her name became simplified to St. Audrey. At these fairs various kinds of cheap knickknacks were sold, along with a type of necklace called  St. Audrey's lace,  which by the 17th century had become altered to  tawdry lace.  Eventually,  tawdry  came to be used to describe anything cheap and gaudy that might be found at these fairs or anywhere else.",

    "etymology": "History and Etymology for  tender AdjectiveMiddle English  tendre, tender,  borrowed from Anglo-French  tendre,  going back to Latin  tener  \"soft, delicate (of persons or parts of the body), immature, yielding easily, sensitive,\" probably by metathesis from  *terenos  or  *terunos,  going back to Indo-European, whence also Greek  t\u00e9r\u0113n  \"soft, tender,\" Sanskrit  taru\u1e47a-  \"young, tender, fresh,\" Avestan  tauruna-  \"young,\" (as noun) \"boy\" Note:  Macrobius (early 5th century), in his  Saturnalia,  quotes Favorinus (ca. 80-160  A.D. ) as claiming that  terenus  meant  mollis  (\"soft\") in Sabine; this form would support the hypothesis of metathesis in Latin  tener.  Ernout and Meillet ( Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique de la langue latine,  4th edition, Paris, 1979) reject this etymology without comment, citing instead a possible connection with the  ten-  of  ten\u0113re, tendere, tenuis  (see  tenant  entry  1 ,  tender  entry  3 ,  thin  entry  1 ). Verb (1)Middle English  tendren,  probably in part derivative of  tendurtender  entry  3 , in part borrowed from its source, Anglo-French  tendreNote:  The apparent use of the Anglo-French nominalized infinitive as an inflected verb in Middle English is paralleled by  render  entry  2 . Cf.  tend  entry  1 , a more regular borrowing of the stem of the same verb, in a different sense. Noun (1)Middle English  tendur  \"grant of a license,\" borrowed from Anglo-French  tendre  \"offer, offer in satisfaction of a debt,\" noun derivative from infinitive of  tendre  \"to stretch, hold out, offer (a suit, plea, money), grant,\" going back to Latin  tendere  \"to extend outward, stretch, spread out, direct (one's course), aim (at a purpose),\" going back to Indo-European  *ten-  \"stretch, extend\" +  *-d-  (or  *-dh- ), suffixal extension of uncertain origin  \u2014 more at  tenant  entry  1Note:  See note at  tenant  entry  1 . The original past participle of  tendere  is  tentus,  which would appear to continue an Indo-European verbal adjective  *tn\u0325-tos,  whence also Greek  tat\u00f3s,  derived directly from the base  *ten-  rather than from  *tend-.  The form  tentus  was largely replaced by  tensus,  presumably from  *tend-tos,  a regular derivative of the new formation  tend-.Noun (2)probably short for  tenderloinNoun (3)  tend  entry  2  +  -er  entry  2Verb (2)Middle English  tendren  \"to become tender, care for, be concerned about,\" derivative of  tender, tendretender  entry  1Noun (4)probably noun derivative of  tender  entry  1  or of  tender  entry  6  in sense \"to be solicitous of\"",

He or she deftly scoots the thimbles around on a table, then asks the player to bet on which one hides the seed. But thimbleriggers are masters of sleight of hand and can move and manipulate the seed unfairly - so the guileless player doesn't stand a chance of winning. (The poor bettor is probably unaware that \"rig\" has meant \"to manipulate or control usually by deceptive or dishonest means\" since the 1800s.) When the same sham is played with nutshells, it's called a \"shell game,\" and there's a related game played with cards known as \"three-card monte.\"",

Actually, it is a distinctive word that existed in English at least a century before  until , both as a preposition meaning \u201cto\u201d and a conjunction meaning \u201cuntil.\u201d  It has seen continuous use in English since the 12th century and is a perfectly legitimate synonym of  until .  \u2019Til  and  \u2019till  are much newer words, having appeared in the language only in the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively.  Both are variant spellings, either of  until  or of  till .  Writers of usage guides have roundly condemned  \u2019till  as a barbarism (apparently because it seems to have added a superfluous  l  to the end of  until ).\u2019Til , for its part, has been deemed inappropriate in formal writing.

To make it clear that the speaker is malicious and the statements made are false, \"calumniate\" is a good option.

The word  trenchant  comes from the Anglo-French verb  trencher , meaning \"to cut,\" and may ultimately derive from the Vulgar Latin  trinicare , meaning \"to cut in three.\" Hence, a trenchant sword is one with a keen edge; a trenchant remark is one that cuts deep; and a trenchant observation is one that cuts to the heart of the matter.

Troubadour  was a fitting name for such creative artists; it derives from an Old Occitan word meaning \"to compose.\" In modern contexts,  troubadour  still refers to the song-meisters of the Middle Ages, but it has been extended to cover contemporary poet-musicians as well.",

The word  tucket  is thought to derive from the obsolete English verb  tuk,  meaning \"to beat a drum\" or \"to sound a trumpet.\" These days, the word  fanfare  itself refers to a sounding of trumpets made in celebration or to alert one of another's arrival. The presence of  fanfare  might be the reason that \"tucket\" is rarely used in contemporary English.",

    "notes": "Did You Know? The word  tyro  is hardly a newcomer to Western language. It comes from the Latin  tiro,  which means \"young soldier,\" \"new recruit,\" or more generally, \"novice.\" The word was sometimes spelled \"tyro\" as early as Medieval Latin, and can be spelled \"tyro\" or \"tiro\" in English (though \"tyro\" is the more common American variant). Use of \"tyro\" in English has never been restricted to the original \"young soldier\" meaning of the Latin term. Writers in the 17th and 18th centuries wrote of tyros in various fields and occupations. Herman Melville used \"tyro\" to refer to men new to whaling and life at sea. More recently,  The New York Times Book Review  and  Rolling Stone  used the noun attributively (that is, directly before another noun), referring to a \"tyro sleuth\" and a \"tyro director,\" respectively.",

    "notes": "Did You Know? Twitter and  tweeting  began in 2006, and two years later folks were referring to those who tweet as  tweeps.  (The word  tweep  persisted despite a reproach by one blogger in 2008: \"Do not post Good morning Twitter peeps! the second you wake up. Or some even more annoying variation like Yo Tweeps!\") Today, the portmanteau  tweep  is easy to accept with the omnipresence of Twitter: it's a blend of Twitter's  tweet  and slang's  peeps.  The slang use of  peeps  for \"people\" became common sometime around the mid-20th century. In a 1951 article in the Chicago Tribune, for example, it was reported that \"high schoolers are greeting each other with 'Hi, peeps' (short for 'hello, people,' of course).\"",

In conversational French, the pronoun \"vous\" (\"you\") is used for formal address of individuals (as well as plural addressees familiar or otherwise), while the singular pronoun \"tu\" (also \"you,\" a relative of Middle English \"thou\") is reserved for use among intimate friends. A person who uses \"tu\" to address his or her elders, for example, is committing a breach of etiquette. The French verb  tutoyer  - literally, \"to address with the pronoun 'tu'\" - was borrowed into English in the late 17th century to refer to this concept. In many cases, the English verb is still used in reference to people speaking French (as English does not discriminate between intimate and formal address in its pronouns), but it is occasionally used to describe casual address among close English speakers.",

This pattern of meaning can also be seen in the related nouns \"tutor\" (which shifted from \"a guardian\" to \"a private teacher\") and \"tuition\" (which now refers to the act or profession of teaching or the cost of instruction but originally meant \"protection, care, or custody especially as exercised by a parent or guardian over a child or ward\").",

Adjective  Tutelary  derives from the Latin noun  tutelarius,  meaning \"guardian.\" \"Tutelarius,\" in turn, was formed by combining the word  tutela  (\"protection\" or \"guardian\") and \"-arius,\" a suffix that implies belonging and connection. A more familiar descendant of \"tutela\" in English might be \"tutelage,\" which initially described an act or process of serving as a guardian or protector but has also come to refer to teaching or influence. If you suspect that \"tutor\" is also related, you are correct. \"Tutelary\" can also be a noun referring to a power (such as a deity) who acts as a guardian.",

Jet engines are gas turbines. A  turbojet  engine uses a turbine to compress the incoming air that feeds the engine before being ejected to push the plane forward; a  turboprop  engine uses its exhaust to drive a turbine that spins a propeller. A wind turbine generates electricity by being turned by the wind; the largest now have vanes with a turning diameter of over 400 feet.",

A typical tu quoque involves charging your accuser with whatever it is you've just been accused of rather than refuting the truth of the accusation - an evasive strategy that may or may not meet with success. The term has been active in the English language for about 400 years and has been put to use by a number of English writers, including C.S. Lewis, who penned, \"your condemnation of my taste is insolent; only manners deter me from a tu quoque.\" The term is Latin in origin and translates as \"you too,\" although the translation \"you're another\" is sometimes used as well (as in our second example sentence).  Tu quoque  functions in English as a noun, but it's often used attributively to modify other nouns, as in  a tu quoque argument.",

Band (1877), pp. 194-98. In this article K\u00fchne says nothing about the origin of the word. In a preceding article (pp. 190-93), taken from K\u00fchne's presentation to a session of the Verein (\"Ueber das Verhalten verschiedener organisirter un sog. ungeformter Fermente,\" \"Sitzung am 4. Februar 1876\"), the following is stated: \"Genauer untersucht wurde besonders das Eiweiss verdauende Enzym des Pankreas, f\u00fcr welches, da es zugleich Spaltung der Albumink\u00f6rper veranlasst, der Name Trypsin gew\u00e4hlt wurde.\" (\"In particular the pancreatic enzyme that digests albumin was more closely investigated, for which the name  trypsin  was chosen, as it accomplishes at the same time cleaving of the albuminous bodies.\") Though the base  tryps-  appears to be a nominal derivative of a Greek verb, no verb is known with an appropriate meaning. The  Oxford English Dictionary  suggests  tr\u00eepsis  \"rubbing, wearing down,\" allegedly because the enzyme is produced by rubbing the pancreas with glycerin, but nothing in K\u00fchne's article supports this, and  y  for expected  i  is unexplained. (In K\u00fchne's procedure the fresh pancreas is initially crushed with alcohol and glass powder.)",

Trumpery  derives from the Middle English  trompery  and ultimately from the Middle French  tromper,  meaning \"to deceive.\" (You can see the meaning of this root reflected in the French phrase  trompe-l'oeil -literally, \"deceives the eye\"-which in English refers to a style of painting with photographically realistic detail.)  Trumpery  first appeared in English in the mid-15th century with the meanings \"deceit or fraud\" (a sense that is now obsolete) and \"worthless nonsense.\" Less than 100 years later, it was being applied to material objects of little or no value. The verb phrase  trump up  means \"to concoct with the intent to deceive,\" but there is most likely no etymological connection between this phrase and  trumpery.",

Truculent  derives from \"truculentus,\" a form of the Latin adjective  trux,  meaning \"savage.\" It has been used in English since the 16th century to describe people or things that are cruel and ferocious, such as tyrannical leaders or wars, and has also come to mean \"deadly or destructive\" (as in \"a truculent disease\"). In current use, however, it has lost much of its etymological fierceness. It now frequently serves to describe speech or writing that is notably harsh (as in \"truculent criticism\") or a person who is notably self-assertive and surly (such as \"a truculent schoolboy\"). Some usage commentators have criticized these extended uses because they do not match the savagery of the word's original sense, but they are well-established and perfectly standard.",

    "notes": "Did You Know? When  truckle  was first used in English in the 15th century, it meant \"small wheel\" or \"pulley.\" Such small wheels were often attached to the underside of low beds, to allow them to be easily moved under high beds for storage. These beds came to be known as  truckle beds  (or  trundle beds ), and a verb  truckle  - meaning \"to sleep in a truckle bed\" - came into being. By the 17th century, the fact that truckle beds were pushed under larger standard beds had inspired a figurative sense of  truckle : \"to yield to the wishes of another\" or \"to bend obsequiously.\" The initial verb meaning became obsolete; the newer sense is fairly rare but is still in use.",

In  phototropism , a plant (or fungus) moves toward light, usually the sun\u2014perhaps because, in the colder climates where such plants are usually found, concentrating the sun's warmth within the sun-seeking flower can create a warm and inviting environment for the insects that fertilize it. In  thigmotropism , the organism moves in response to being touched; most climbing plants, for example, put out tiny tendrils that feel around for something solid and then attach themselves or curl around it. When microbiologists talk about tropism, however, they're often referring instead to the way a virus will seek out a particular type of cell to infect. And when intellectuals use the word, they usually mean a tendency shown by a person or group which they themselves might not even be aware of.",

    "etymology": "History and Etymology for  troll Noun (1)Norwegian  troll  & Danish  trold , from Old Norse  troll  giant, demon; probably akin to Middle High German  trolle  lout VerbMiddle English  trollen  \"to roll, rock (the head),\" of uncertain origin Note:  Probably ultimately a sound-symbolic verb whose divergent meanings are difficult to reconcile historically, suggesting multiple creations or sources. The earliest meaning was \"to roll\" in various contexts; perhaps derived from this was \"to sing in the manner of a round or catch.\" The sense \"to roam\" is possibly attested in the Piers Plowman B text (\"And thus hath he [Jesus] trolled forth : this two & thretty wynter\"), though the interpretation is uncertain and comparable instances are only known centuries later. This use has conventionally been linked with Middle French  treler, traler, treiller  \"(of hunting dogs) look for prey without a trail or the use of a scent hound,\" and 16th-century  troller  \"to wander from place to place (originally of a dog).\" The sense \"to fish by trailing a lure or bait from a moving boat,\" if not of independent origin, may have been influenced by  trail  entry  1  and  trawl  entry  1 ; also perhaps of relevance is French  treuil  \"winch,\" though most early uses of  troll  in this sense do not employ a comparable noun in the meaning \"winch\" or \"reel\" (see, for example, Robert Nobbes,  The Compleat Troller, or the Art of Trolling,  London, 1682). Sense 2, attested from the early 1990's, is probably in part from the fishing sense, in part a derivative of  troll  entry  3 . Noun (2)earlier, \"the act of trolling\" (in various senses), derivative of  troll  entry  1 ; sense 2 in part by association with  troll  entry  1",

Mathematicians use the word to refer to the mathematically simplest case, but the rest of us tend to use it just to mean \"unimportant.\" \"Small talk\" at a party, for example, is usually trivial conversation. To  trivialize  something is to treat it as if it doesn't matter, as if it is just another  triviality .",

But if written references are any indication, the phenomenon isn't all that old (at least, not among English speakers). Known mention of fear of thirteen in print dates back only to the late 1800s. By circa 1911, however, it was prevalent enough to merit a name, which was formed by attaching the Greek word for \"thirteen\" -  treiskaideka  (dropping that first \"e\") - to  phobia  (\"fear of\").",

Dozens of tragic trilogies were written for the Greek stage, though only one, Aeschylus's great  Oresteia  (consisting of  Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, *and *The Eumenides ), has survived complete. Authors in later years have occasionally chosen to create trilogies to allow themselves to develop a highly complex story or cover a long span of time. Tolkien's  Lord of the Rings  wasn't actually intended as a trilogy, but since it was published in three volumes it's usually called one. George Lucas's three original  Star Wars  movies are an example of a film trilogy (which he followed many years later by another).",

    "etymology": "History and Etymology for  trilobite  borrowed from German  Trilobit,  from New Latin  trilobus  \"three-lobed\" (borrowed from Greek  tr\u00edlobos,  from  tri-tri-  +  -lobos,  adjective derivative of  lob\u00f3slobe ) + German  -it-ite  entry  1Note:  German  Trilobit  was introduced by the theologian and naturalist Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch (1725-78) in  Die Naturgeschichte der Versteinerungen zur Erl\u00e4uterung der Knorrischen Sammlung von Merkw\u00fcrdigkeiten der Natur  (\"The Natural History of Fossils, as a Commentary on the Knorr Collection of the Curiosities of Nature\"),  3. Theil  (Nuremberg, 1771) p. 120 and following. This work, in four parts issued from 1768 to 1773, was an expanded and greatly improved edition of a publication begun by the Nuremberg engraver and fossil collector Georg Wolfgang Knorr, who had died in 1761. According to Walch, \"Da man dieses Petrefact Anfangs nur St\u00fcckweise entdeckte, und nicht wusste, zu was vor einer Gattung von K\u00f6rpern man dasselbe rechnen sollte, so hielte sich fast jeder Naturforscher, der dasselbe bekannt machte, f\u00fcr berechtiget, ihm einen eigenen Nahmen beyzulegen\u2026[there follows a discussion of various names, as  concha tr\u00edlobos  [latter word in Greek letters],  concha triloba rugosa, pectunculites trilobus, entomolithus paradoxus, Dudley fossil,  etc.]\u2026Alle aber, zusammen genommen, sind ihm gegeben worden, entweder von seiner Gestalt und Aenlichkeit, die es mit andern K\u00f6rpern hat, oder von dem vermeintlichen Original, so man, wiewohl meist ohne Grund, daf\u00fcr angesehen, oder von dem Ort und Gegend, wo man dasselbe gefunden. Wir wollen ihm die allersimpelste Benennung beylegen, und es einen Trilobiten nennen\" (\"Since early on only fragments of the fossil had been discovered, and no one knew the category of body under which it should be considered, almost every investigator of nature who made it known felt justified in conferring on it his own name\u2026Taken together, all these names have been given either from its shape and similarity to other bodies, or from what is regarded, usually without any basis, as the presumed prototype, or from the place where it was found. We want to confer on it the simplest name possible, and call it a trilobite\"). (Walch uses  Trilobit  as a weak noun, with an accusative singular  Trilobiten. ) Walch's  Naturgeschichte der Versteinerungen  was translated into Dutch (3rd Part, 1773) and French (3rd Part, 1775), with the animal designated respectively as  Trilobiet  and  Trilobite  in these languages. Further details about Walch, as well as an English translation of the French version of relevant passages from  Naturgeschichte der Versteinerungen,  can be found in Robert Kihm and James St. John, \"Walch's Trilobite Research\u2014A Translation of His 1771 Trilobite Chapter,\"  Fabulous Fossils\u2014300 Years of Worldwide Research on Trilobites,  edited by D.G. Mikulic, et al.,  New York State Museum Bulletin  507 (Albany, 2007), pp. 115-40. Note that Walch only uses  Trilobit  as a vernacular designation; the class name  Trilobita,  though attributed to Walch in taxonomic literature, does not appear in the book.",

It is found in everything from advertisements to media company names to casual speech.  Trifecta  combines the prefix  tri - (meaning \u201cthree\u201d) with the last element in  perfecta , a word of American Spanish origin that refers to a horse-racing bet in which the first- and second-place finishers are chosen correctly.",

The word  trichotillomania  derives from the Greek  trich-  (\"hair\") and  tillein  (\"to pull or pluck\"), along with the suffix  -mania  (from  mainesthai,  meaning \"to be mad\"). People suffering from trichotillomania will routinely pluck hair from the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes or other parts of the body, usually impulsively but sometimes with careful deliberation (such as by using tweezers). Some researchers believe that it may be a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The word for this condition first appeared in English around the dawn of the 20th century (it's generally thought to have been first coined in French by a French dermatologist).",

Although you can accurately call the person who cuts your hair your \"trichologist\" if you want to, the term is usually applied as it is in our example sentence: to someone who studies and treats hair and scalp ailments. The \"trich\" in \"trichologist\" is the Greek  trich-,  stem of  thrix,  meaning \"hair.\" This root makes an appearance in a number of other similarly technical-sounding words, such as \"trichiasis\" (\"a turning inward of the eyelashes often causing irritation of the eyeball\"), \"trichome\" (\"an epidermal hair structure on a plant\"), and \"trichotillomania\" (\"an abnormal desire to pull out one's hair\").",

Ancient China, for instance, had dozens of  tributary  states, and the emperor would receive elephants from Siam or young girls from Korea as tribute. Just as a smaller power gave some of its wealth to a larger power, a small river contributes its waters to a larger one. A tributary can be a tiny stream, but some are immense rivers. The Missouri River, for example, could be called a tributary to the Mississippi, even though it's about 2,500 miles long and receives hundreds of tributaries itself.",

A D-major triad is made up of the notes D, F-sharp, and A; an F-minor triad is made up of F, A-flat, and C; and so on. Major and minor triads form the basis of tonal music, and songs and other pieces usually end with a  triadic  harmony. In medicine, a triad is a set of three symptoms that go together. The Chinese criminal  organizations called triads got their name from the triangular symbol that they  used back when they began, centuries ago, as patriotic organizations. Today, with over 100,000 members, the triads operate in the U.S., Canada, and many other countries.",

Since wild animals are often known to bite, these words gave rise to  th\u0113riak\u0113,  meaning \"antidote against a poisonous bite.\" Latin borrowed  th\u0113riak\u0113  as \"theriaca,\" and the word eventually entered Anglo-French - and then Middle English - as \"triacle.\" The senses of \"treacle\" that refer to molasses developed from the earlier \"antidote\" sense. The \"molasses\" sense, in turn, was extended to give us a word for things excessively sweet or sentimental.",

We don't know exactly what a trepalium looked like, but the word's history gives us an idea.  Trepalium  is derived from the Latin  tripalis , which means \"having three stakes\" (from  tri- , meaning \"three,\" and  palus , meaning \"stake\"). From  trepalium  sprang the Anglo-French verb  travailler , which originally meant \"to torment\" but eventually acquired the milder senses \"to trouble\" and \"to journey.\" The Anglo-French noun  travail  was borrowed into English in the 13th century, followed about a century later by  travel , another descendant of  travailler .",

From this technical use developed a figurative sense:  to escape from secrecy,  or  to become known.  That sense was often used in ambiguous contexts and could be taken to mean  happen.  (For example, Emily Dickinson wrote in a letter,  I long to see you once more ... to tell you of many things which have transpired since we parted. ) Thus the  to take place  sense developed. Around 1870, usage critics began to attack this sense as a misuse, and modern critics occasionally echo that sentiment. But the sense has been common for two centuries and today is found in serious and polished prose.",

It's also possible to see a number of other \"specere\" descendants in English, including \"aspect,\" \"circumspect,\" \"expect,\" \"inspect,\" \"perspective,\" and \"suspect.\" Another descendant of \"specere,\" and a close synonym of \"transpicuous,\" is \"perspicuous,\" which means \"clear and easy to understand,\" as in \"a perspicuous argument.\" (\"Per-,\" like  trans-,  means \"through.\") There's also  perspicacious,  meaning \"keen and observant.\" (You might say that \"perspicuous\" and \"transpicuous\" mean \"able to be seen through,\" whereas  perspicacious  means \"able to see through.\")",

    "notes": "Alchemist : Someone Who Transforms Things for the Better Today we recognize  alchemy  as a pseudoscience, and give  chemistry  its rightful place as a serious scientific field, but the two terms initially overlapped in meaning before separating by the 17th century, just as  astrology  and  astronomy  did during the same period.  Alchemy  and  alchemist  are in fact older words than  chemistry  and  chemist  in English. Alchemists believed that lead could be \u201cperfected\u201d into gold, that diseases could be cured, and that life could be prolonged through  transmutation , or a change of some essential element into a superior form. Their secretive experiments, usually involving heat and the mixing of liquids, led to the development of pharmacology and the rise of modern chemistry.  The long route to English for  alchemist  began with the Greek word  ch\u0113meia , which probably came from the word  chyma  (\u201cfluid\u201d), derived from the verb  chein , meaning \u201cto pour.\u201d It then passed to Arabic, which added its definite article  al-  (\u201cthe\u201d) to the Greek root. The word then passed from Latin to French before coming to English. Some other words derived from Arabic also retain the  al-  in English, such as  algebra ,  algorithm , and  alcohol ; in fact, the transformative liquid that was constantly being sought through experimentation by alchemists is another word with the Arabic  al-  prefix:  elixir .  This power to transform things for the better, real or imagined, led to figurative meanings for  alchemy  and  alchemist .",

A  transitive verb  is a verb that requires a  direct object , which is a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase that follows the verb and completes the sentence's meaning by indicating the person or thing that receives the action of the verb. The direct object typically answers the question  what?  or  whom? :  The kids  like  pickles.  That really  annoys  me.  Have they  sold  their house yet? An  intransitive verb  is not used with a direct object. If something comes after an intransitive verb, that is, in the position usually inhabited by the direct object, it doesn't answer  what?  or  whom? ; instead it answers a question like  where? ,  when? ,  how? , or  how long? :  Her car  died  suddenly last week.  Someone was  coughing  loudly. A single verb can have both transitive and intransitive uses:  They are  playing  soccer.  They've been  playing  all afternoon. A transitive verb can also have an  indirect object , which is a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase that comes before a direct object and indicates the person or thing that receives what is being given or done. Many common verbs can be used with both direct and indirect objects. In the following examples the indirect object is in italics:  Find  her  a chair.  Can you read  me  the letter?  Who gave  her lawyers  the information?  He's saving  Caitlin  a piece.",

Transfiguration  was first used in English as the name of this biblical event, and the Feast of the Transfiguration  remains the name of a holy day. So the word has always kept a somewhat religious\u2014and almost always positive\u2014tone. A face may be transfigured by joy, and an \"ugly duckling\" may be slowly transfigured into a radiant beauty.

Today, it is often used specifically of an issue of bonds that is differentiated from other issues by such factors as maturity or rate of return. Another use of the French word  tranche  is in the French phrase  une tranche de vie , meaning \"a cross section of life.\" That phrase was coined by the dramatist Jean Jullien (1854-1919), who advocated  naturalism  in the theater.",

Tractable  describes an individual whose character permits easy handling, while  docile  implies a predisposition to submit readily to authority.  Obedient  is often used to describe compliance with authority, although that compliance is not necessarily offered eagerly.  Amenable , on the other hand, is usually used when one cooperates out of a desire to be agreeable.  Tractable  dates from the early 16th century and derives from the Latin verb  tractare  (\"to handle\" or \"to treat\"). Despite the resemblance, this root did not give us the noun  tractor  or verbs such as  contract  or  attract -those all derive from a loosely related Latin verb  trahere  (\"to draw or drag\").",

A more ubiquitous descendant of  toxon  is \"toxic.\"  Toxic  is an anglicization of Latin's word for \"poison,\"  toxicum,  which originally meant \"poison for arrows\" and is a borrowing from Greek  toxikon,  meaning \"arrow.\"",

For centuries South American tribes have used the toxin curare, extracted from a native vine, to tip their arrows. The garden flower called wolfsbane or monkshood is the source of aconite, an extremely potent toxin. The common flower known as jimsonweed contains the deadly poison scopolamine. And the castor-oil plant yields the almost unbelievably poisonous toxin called ricin. Today we hear health advisers of all kinds talk about ridding the body of toxins; but they're usually pretty vague about which ones they mean, and most of these \"toxins\" wouldn't be called that by biologists.",

Thus, it's possible to die from drinking too much water, and lives have been saved by tiny doses of arsenic.  Even though botulinum toxin  is the most  toxic  substance known, it's the basic ingredient in Botox, which is injected into the face to get rid of wrinkles. With some poisons, mere skin contact can be lethal; others are lethal when breathed into the lungs in microscopic amounts.  To determine if a chemical will be officially called a poison, researchers often use the \"LD50\" test: If 50 milligrams of the substance for every kilogram of an animal's body weight results in the death of 50% of test animals, the chemical is a poison. But  there are problems with such tests, and toxicity remains a very individual concept.",

The \"criterion\" sense, which goes back more than 470 years, alludes to a method of testing the purity of a sample of gold. The sample was rubbed on a piece of dark quartz or jasper - the \"touchstone.\" The mark it made was compared to adjacent rubbings on the touchstone from gold of known purity.

The twists and turns that mark a tortuous thing can be literal (\"a tortuous path\" or \"a tortuous river\") or figurative (\"a tortuous argument\" or \"a tortuous explanation\"), but you should consider choosing a different descriptive term if no implication of winding or crookedness is present.",

    "notes": "Did You Know? Tort  came into English straight from French many centuries ago, and it still looks a little odd. Its root meaning of \"twisted\" (as opposed to \"straight\") obviously came to mean \"wrong\" (as opposed to \"right\"). Every first-year law student takes a course in the important subject of torts. Torts include all the so-called \"product-liability\" cases, against manufacturers of cars, household products, children's toys, and so on. They also cover dog bites, slander and libel, and a huge variety of other very personal cases of injury, both mental and physical\u2014Torts class is never dull.

The term \"torrid zone\" later came about to refer to tropical regions of the Earth. By the end of that century the word had taken on the extended meaning that we know today - suggesting fiery passion.",

It began showing up again in the early 1600s in reference to both mental and physical sluggishness.

Noun  Like the adjective \"torpid,\" \"torpedo\" can be traced back to the Latin verb  torp\u0113re,  meaning \"to be sluggish or numb.\" In Latin  torpedo  referred to stiffness or numbness, and also to the crampfish or electric ray. \"Torpedo\" first entered English as a name for the electric ray. During the Napoleonic Wars, the American inventor Robert Fulton experimented with an explosive charge for use against warships which he called a \"torpedo\" (and which we would now refer to as a mine), after the electric ray's ability to incapacitate creatures it comes in contact with. Fulton was also the inventor of the \"Nautilus,\" an early hand-powered submarine which was one of the precursors of the vessels that would deliver the more familiar cigar-shaped torpedoes with such devastating effects during the 20th century's two World Wars.",
